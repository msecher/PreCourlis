description=Create geometry - sediment layered 1D cross-sections - of rivers for COURLIS which is the sediment transport module for MASCARET, the 1D free surface flow code of the Open TELEMAC-MASCARET platform (http://www.opentelemac.org/)

# about=This plugin allows you to model the bed of rivers and export data for the Courlis module of Telemac-Mascaret
about=This plugin allows you to:
    - import georeferenced MASCARET geometry,
    - extract geometric information from a DEM (raster) on polylines representing the cross-sections of the MASCARET-COURLIS model in respect with a user defined discretization,
    - interpolate cross sections along an hydraulic axis in respect with user defined longitudinal (number of cross-sections) and lateral (number of points on each profile) discretization,
    - visualize the cross-sections in a graphical view,
    - add sediment layers and bed rock to the cross-sections from river bed geometry (identical or with a Z shift) or from another DEM (raster),
    - modify manually or with some functionality more automatic the river bed geometry, sediment layers geometry or bedrock geometry,
    - and export data for the COURLIS module
    PRECOURLIS is using :
    - A fork of TatooineMesher (courtesy of CNR Engineering, https://github.com/CNR-Engineering/TatooineMesher)
    - Modified version of Python classes of the TELEMAC-MASCARET system
